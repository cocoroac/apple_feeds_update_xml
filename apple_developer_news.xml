<description>Give users even more confidence in your software distributed outside the Mac App Store by submitting it to Apple to be notarized.

Starting spring of 2019, macOS Mojave will more prominently highlight notarization status.  In an upcoming macOS release, Gatekeeper will require Developer ID–signed software to be notarized by Apple. Learn more and view new documentation</description>
